# ONVS

ONVS is the `Observatoire National des Violences en Sant√©`, a web app to declare any violence for medical people in France.

### üß° Architecture

The product is composed of :

- a Next.js app, responsible of both the frontend and the API
- a db container which uses a Postgresql Docker image

This architecture is described in docker configuration files.

### üëî Install

First, install git, yarn, docker, docker-compose (you can use brew if you are on Mac OS).

Then, run the containers with docker-compose.

```shell script
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will build and run the db container and the app container.

Then, on the host machine, the db is exposed on port 5435 and the app is accessible on port 80.

### üéõÔ∏è Env vars

You need to set `process.env` variables.

- PORT port to run the server on
- DATABASE_URL URL of Postgres DB
- POSTGRES_SSL true if the database uses a db URL with https
- SENTRY_DSN DSN of your sentry project
- SENTRY_TOKEN token to allow sourcemaps
- MATOMO_URL URL to your piwik instance
- MATOMO_SITE_ID site id on piwik instance
- MAIL_HOST Mailing server config
- MAIL_PORT
- MAIL_USERNAME
- MAIL_PASSWORD
- MAIL_USE_TLS defaults to true
- MAIL_FROM email sender
- MAIL_TO email recipients as a comma separated string
- MAIL_WEBHOOK_TOKEN token used to authenticate the cron for the email webhook

The easiest solution to set the variables, is to populate the `.env` file at root of the project. See the `.env.sample`file for example of this.

The API is also provided by this product. For example, of the frontend stage environment is `https://onvs-dev.fabrique.social.gouv.fr`, the api part is `https://onvs-dev.fabrique.social.gouv.fr/api`.

### üë©‚Äçüç≥ Local development

The developers can benefit of the hot reload provided by Next.js. for an improved DX.

In this case, just configure a db URL in your `.env` file, then

```shell script
yarn install
yarn dev
```

You can use the db container inside the docker-compose.yml. In this case, the DATABASE_URL looks like `DATABASE_URL=psql://onvs:password@localhost:5435/onvs`.

One step further, if you want to getting close to the production build, you can use

```shell script
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

Then, go to the app at [http://localhost:3030/](http://localhost:3030/).

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run the tests

There is some Jest tests, which can be run with :

```shell script
yarn run test
```

### üßØ Troubleshoot

_How can I see the logs ?_

```shell script
# To see the logs for the both containers
docker-compose logs -f

# To see only the app container
docker-compose logs -f app
```

In k8s environments, go to Rancher, select the pod and clic on View logs.

### üìß Debuging emails

A fake SMTP server is setup in docker-compose file. It can be accessed at http://localhost:37408/.
